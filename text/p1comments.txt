If you acheived a correctness score of 80 or higher by the deadline,
you will be given three different potential solutions to Project
1. For each potential solution, answer the following questions:

1: Do you believe this solution correctly terminates all spawned
goroutines before ManagerImpl returns? Why or why not?

2: Does this solution have any design decisions, architecture
features, or code organization techniques that you found particularly
compelling? If so, what were they?

3: Do you have any comments for the author of this code? In answering
this question, please be sure your comments are: true, necessary,
kind, and helpful. In other words, be *professional* and *courteous*
in making these comments.
